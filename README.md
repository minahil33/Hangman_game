# Hangman Game üéÆ (Python)
Overview

This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess it letter by letter. The player has six chances to make wrong guesses before the game ends. With every incorrect guess, the hangman figure progresses until either the player wins by finding the word or loses when all attempts are used.

Features

Random word selection from a list.

One-letter input system for guesses.

Tracks and prevents repeated guesses.

Displays the current progress of the guessed word.

Shows hangman drawing after each wrong attempt.

Ends with a clear win or loss message.

How It Works

A word is chosen randomly from a stored list.

The chosen word is hidden with underscores.

The player enters one letter at a time to guess the word.

If the letter is correct, it is revealed in the hidden word.

If the letter is wrong, the number of attempts decreases and the hangman figure updates.

The game continues until the word is fully guessed or no attempts are left.
